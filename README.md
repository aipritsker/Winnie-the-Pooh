Winnie-the-Pooh
===============
This project is taken almost entirely from Wanyi Zhu's beeproject, but I may make some changes.
In particular, I am reorganizing the code so that it's easier for me to work with (fewer files). 
Things I would like to potentially (eventually) change:
*honey collection subroutine, as well as seasonal honey consumption.  Should be driven by brood rearing, etc.
