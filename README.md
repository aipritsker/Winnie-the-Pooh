Winnie-the-Pooh
===============
This project is taken almost entirely from Wanyi Zhu's beeproject, with minor changes by AIP and TCR.
To run the code, simply compile simulator.m
This will run the honey dynamics subroutine (if needed), and then the population dynamics simuation.

In particular, I am reorganizing the code so that it's easier for me to work with (fewer files). 
Things I would like to potentially (eventually) change:
*honey collection subroutine, as well as seasonal honey consumption.  Should be driven by brood rearing, etc.
