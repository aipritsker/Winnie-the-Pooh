Winnie-the-Pooh
===============
This project is taken almost entirely from Wanyi Zhu's beeproject, with minor changes by AIP and TCR.
To run the code, simply compile simulator.m
This will run the honey dynamics subroutine (if needed), and then the population dynamics simuation.

In particular, the code is being reorganized so that it is more hierarchical in nature.

Next step is to *make all parameters feed from simulator.m to other files
                *fix whatever is wrong with winter- too many eggs, somehting is screwed up
                *not enough honey or pollen in the current version


Things I would like to potentially add to expand the model:
*honey collection subroutine, as well as seasonal honey consumption.  Should be driven by brood rearing and landscape.
*winter energetic model
